# VAE and Diffusion Models: A Step-by-Step Guide

This repository contains educational Jupyter notebooks that explore the theory and
implementation of generative models, specifically **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
and **Diffusion Models**. These notebooks are designed to provide a clear, step-by-step
understanding of how these powerful generative AI techniques work.

### [`02.vae-without-encoder.ipynb`](./02.vae-without-encoder.ipynb) ‚Äì Simplified VAE (Decoder-Only)

This notebook explores a "VAE-like" model that omits the encoder:

- One-step fixed corruption process as "inference"
- Connection between this simplified model and diffusion models
- Implementation of a noise prediction objective
- Demonstration of how this approach performs on MNIST data

### [`03.diffusion.ipynb`](./03.diffusion.ipynb) ‚Äì Diffusion Models

This comprehensive notebook dives into diffusion models:

- Forward and reverse processes in diffusion models
- Beta schedules (linear vs. cosine)
- Variational inference and the ELBO objective for diffusion
- Simplified noise prediction objective
- Implementation of a diffusion model with:
  - ShuffleNet-based UNet architecture
